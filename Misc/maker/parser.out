Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . line
    (1) line -> . INCLUDE FILENAME
    (2) line -> . CATCHALL

    INCLUDE         shift and go to state 2
    CATCHALL        shift and go to state 3

    line                           shift and go to state 1

state 1

    (0) S' -> line .



state 2

    (1) line -> INCLUDE . FILENAME

    FILENAME        shift and go to state 4


state 3

    (2) line -> CATCHALL .

    $end            reduce using rule 2 (line -> CATCHALL .)


state 4

    (1) line -> INCLUDE FILENAME .

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (line -> INCLUDE FILENAME .)
