A* Search Structure Requirements/Interface

AStarSearch has self.map attribute

self.map has:
	reset_for_search() # does any initialization for new search
	locate(logical_coords_tuple) # returns the node containing the given logical coordinates
	find_adjacent(node) # returns a list of orthagonally adjacent nodes

node needs to have:
	astar_status # new, open, closed 
	astar_dist_travel # real distance traveled to this point
	astar_dist_remain # estimated remaining distance to goal
	astar_score # sum of real + estimated distances
	astar_parent # parent in current possible solution
	
	estimated_distance(to_node)
	real_distance(to_node)
