NOTES:
'filler' is maintained for compatibility and is not used
the atom type must be given as the symbol for the element (e.g. H, He...) or a
    question mark (?) for wildcard
blank lines are allowed (but can contain NO characters whatsoever)

NOTES:
num_variants is the number of different configurations that are given (m)
the config values are optional values to indicate configuration of membership
    in the matching given group; must match the number of occurences exactly (see index)
    * indicates that it doesnt matter whether the corresponding atom is in the
    structure or not (0 or more), + indicates membership of any amount (1 or more)
    these two values allow attached structures of the same type to still match
    each individually rather than neither (useful with rings, fused rings)
    groups that have symmetric structure but asymmetric values (wildcards included)
    should have configs for all possible versions of the symmetry
DEFAULT indicates the default energy (no modifying structures)
priority indicates the match priority for this variant, lower is better
energy_value can be decimal
modifier is the name of the modifier group associated with the given value, i.e.
    BENZENE
index indicates which configuration of membership in the modifier group the
    given energy matches (the indices also serve to prioritize the assignments, lowest first)
exclusive indicates that specified values (not * or +) for the config can't have the
    given tag
name is the name this modifier group has, it is the string that appears as the
    'modifier' argument in other files
NOBOND indicates that the bond strengths should be ignored when matching and should
    only be used when specifying generic modifer structures
CORRECTION indicates the structure should be matched and the default energy assigned
    immediately, then discarded (CORRECTION and MODIFIER are NOT mutually exclusive)
any flags, indicated by a leading 'M', are optional
any wildcards that exist in a modifier structure WILL be tagged with that modifier

DIRECTORY dir
fgroup_filename_1 fgroup_1_priority
...
fgroup_filename_n fgroup_n_priority

NOTES:
DIRECTORY indicates that the following files (up to EOF or another DIRECTORY) are
    in 'dir'; it defaults to the current directory
the priorities dictate precendence when assigning a final layout of matches to
    atom (covering), lower means earlier
