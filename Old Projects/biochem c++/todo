ignore match (i.e. dont cover) if alternates fail and there is no default
better, expansible way to pass around match parameters (other than series of bools)

bonus functionality:
detect if the molfile is invalid (namely wrong numbers for atom/bond counts)
use lowercase for atomic symbols
silent/verbose/debug modes for printing
change matchinfo to a class, integrate comparison, matches as indices functions
error checking in add_hydrogen for invalid molecules
