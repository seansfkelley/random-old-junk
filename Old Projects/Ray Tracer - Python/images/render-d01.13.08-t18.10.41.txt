notes: Fixed the hollow-box problem, and I have no idea how. I rewrote a small part of the terrain generation function, because I thought I had narrowed down the error to there. The rewritten part was the same as the original. I added something, it worked, I took it out as a test, and it still worked. I suspect the problem was IDLE remembering variables from previous executions of the program, but now multiple execution in the same process don't mess it up. I don't know, but I'm not complaining.
