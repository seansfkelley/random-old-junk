notes: The second of two images to compare lighting. This one is noticeably darker, which is good. The method seems to work (though it's a bit of an approximation as far as I can tell, it's nevertheless a good one). The next step is to experiment with lower-than-1 values for light to see how they interact, but more importantly to get falloff on the intensity of the light working.
