notes: First test of multiple light sources. It seems to work, but I know it doesn't: the method used averages ALL light source together, which must be wrong. If there's a cube with two light sources on opposite sides, one of said sides will be 100% illunimated by one source and 0% by the other. Averaging these to 50% doesn't make sense.
